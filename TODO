TODO:
 - turn this into a jquery plugin.
 - figure out how to solve the issue of loading too many tiles/images... once the user has scrolled so much... memory will start to get out of hand... in that case I need to maybe start removing nodes... but I will also need to manage it properly... and scrolling may be a bit messed up... may be a challenge.
 - make sure all the skeleton features work.
 - remove $this. We shouldn just reorganize out code so this is always in context.
 - add an end. Let the user define what the end looks like when we call moreResults
 - save the scroll data to local storage or something, so when the user comes back to the page, we immediately load exactly where they were and scroll them to that position.
 - you shouldn't set variables, but instead call methods.
 - preloading images?
 - load more at index from url or data. May be future scope.

(note, didn't actually get started till 11:50... stupid apis... they all are too gungho about security and won't let me access them client side.)
